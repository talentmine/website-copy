## Email Service Provider Integration

Build a robust email service abstraction layer that seamlessly integrates with multiple providers, ensuring reliable delivery through automatic failover.

#### Key skills you will gain

- Designing and building RESTful APIs
- Handling HTTP requests and responses
- Using third-party APIs
- Building abstraction layers
- Testing and debugging

#### Project Brief

In this project, you will design and implement a robust email-sending service that integrates seamlessly with multiple email service providers. Your task is to create an abstraction layer that allows for smooth switching between different email providers in case of failure, ensuring reliability and uninterrupted service for your users. This project will strengthen your skills in building scalable APIs, handling third-party integrations, and implementing fault-tolerant systems.

#### Project Requirements

- Service Functionality: Build a backend service that accepts necessary email information (e.g., recipient, subject, body). Your service will interface with two different ESPs (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.).
- Provider Abstraction: Implement an abstraction layer that allows for easy switching between email providers. If one provider fails (due to downtime or API errors), the service should automatically switch to the backup provider.
- Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and logging to monitor failures and provider-switching events.
- Scalability: Consider the scalability of your service, ensuring it can handle increasing loads of email requests.
